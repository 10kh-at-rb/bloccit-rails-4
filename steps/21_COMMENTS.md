# Comments

I think this would be a _great_ one for students to do on their own. We've covered _everything_ already. This is just going to be a simple list of comments. One of the future excercises could extend this so that comments have a polymorphic relationship and be able to comment on comments.

I think you would outline the steps they need to go through

* Add user to comment (migration + modify models)
* Modify seed file
* Grab comments in the posts_controller
* Display comments on show page
* Add comment controler
* Modify routes
* Modify the abilities
* Add validations



## Other things worth covering

* Talk about `only` option in routes
* Do quick lesson on partial + collection
* Security / altenatives to how to create the form
* Show how to render a view from a different controller

[Resource](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-render) for renderign collection and rendering a view from a different controller.
